## NLP TensorFlow Tutorials
This repository basically contains a list of several tutorials on how to perform NLP using TensorFlow. 

## Important Notice!
Note that if you want to successfully reproduce any of the tutorials you may need access to the datasets and some other important folders that are missing here. Due to storage restrictions on GitHub, it's not possible to upload the folders directly. These tutorials are just for reference at the moment so that you can study and understand a bit of the TensorFlow framework and how it can be used for NLP implementaitons. I would encourage you to write me an email at ellfae@gmail if you are interested in reproducing any of the tutorials. I usually repond within a day. 

This is a work in progress. I will keep updating and organizing this repository as I continue to write more tutorials about NLP using TensorFlow. You can always look around my profile for full repositories and my other works.
